## Extension Settings

* `azureStorage.showExplorer`: Set to `false` to hide Azure Storage Explorer
* `azureStorage.storageExplorerLocation`:  [Mac only] Set to `"Path/To/Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer.app"` to override the default location.
* `azureStorage.file.showSavePrompt`: Set to `false` to prevent showing a warning dialog on File file save.
* `azureStorage.blob.showSavePrompt`: Set to `false` to prevent showing a warning dialog on Blob file save.

## Deploy to Static Website

* Note that static websites are an Azure preview feature and is only supported for GPv2 storage accounts.

* When configuring your storage account for static site hosting, you **must** set the *index document name*. Do not leave it empty, even if the watermark says "index.html" (you must actually type "index.html" into the textbox and click Save).

* See the [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/static-website/getting-started)

## Managing Azure Subscriptions

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "Create a Free Azure Account..." or selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "filter" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions". Note that this selection affects all VS Code extensions that support the [Azure Account and Sign-In](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) extension.

## Known Issues

This extension focuses on simple developer and editing scenarios that are convenient from within VS Code.  Therefore, the following scenarios are not supported:

* Classic Azure Storage Accounts not supported.
* Viewing diagnostics and logs tables is not supported.
* Viewing the contents of tables and queues is not supported.
* Uploading or downloading binary files (except images) is not supported.
* Uploading or downloading of blobs is limited to text file types, block blobs and up to 4MB in size. Uploading and downloading of files in file shares is not currently supported.

For these scenarios and other advanced features, please use [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com), which is free and available cross-platform for Linux, MacOS and Windows.
