## Extension Settings

* `azureStorage.showExplorer`: Set to `false` to hide Azure Storage Explorer
* `azureStorage.storageExplorerLocation`: Set to `"Path/To/Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer.app"` to override the default location.
* `azureStorage.file.showSavePrompt`: Set to `false` to prevent showing a warning dialog on File file save.

## Known Issues

This extension focuses on simple developer and editing scenarios that are convenient from within VS Code.  Therefore, the following scenarios are not supported:

* Classic Azure Storage Accounts not supported.
* Viewing diagnostics and logs tables is not supported.
* Viewing the contents of tables and queues is not supported.
* Uploading or downloading binary files (except images) is not supported.

For these scenarios and other advanced features, please use [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com), which is free and available cross-platform for Linux, MacOS and Windows.
Feedback on supported or desired features, as well as issues that you find, is always encouraged. Simply enter an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurestorage/issues).
