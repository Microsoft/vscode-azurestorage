## Signing In and Out of Azure and Filtering Subscriptions

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "key" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions".
